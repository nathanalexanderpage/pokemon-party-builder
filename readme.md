# Pokemon Party Planner
Are these parties birthday parties? No! These parties are your in-game teams of six. If you've ever played through the games you may know that difficulty choosing the members of your team is a real thing. You can end up having teams that are not at all diverse in type, movesets, stats, role, etc.
That is where the Pokemon Party Planner app comes in handy. Just create an account, go to the "search" section, and add Pokemon that strike your fancy! All added Pokemon will appear on your profile page where you can jump into their specific pages and choose their ability and movesets.
